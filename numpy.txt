Numpy:
- ndarray: fast and space-efficient multidimensional array providing vectorized arithmetic operations and sophisticated broadcasting capabilities
- fast operations on entire arrays without having to write loops
- tools for integrating code written in C, C++ and Fortran
- import numpy as np
- ndarray: homogeneous data
- shape, dtype
- np.array([4,5,6])
- vectorization: batch operations on data without writing any for loops
- indexing and slicing
- broadcasting: operations between differently sized arrays, e.g. assign scalar to a slice (value is propagated/broadcasted to the entire selection)
- array slices are views on the original data
- boolean indexing
- fancy indexing: indexing using integer arrays
- transposing arrays and swapping axis
- universal functions (ufunc): performs elementwise operations on data in ndarrays (--> fast vectorized wrappers for simple functions), e.g. sqrt,exp
- expressing contidional logic as array operations: numpy.where (vectorized version of the ternary expression x if condition else y)
- mathematical and statistical methods: sum, mean, ...
- linear algebra: numpy.linalg (dot, ...)
