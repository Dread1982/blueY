Estimator: 
 - must be fitted to the model
 - fit(X,y) 
 - predict(T)
 - score()

cross-validation:
 - to improve fitting of the model and avoid over-fitting
 - over-fitting = fits perfectly on train but not good on test data
 - k-fold cv: split in k chunks and use one as test, repeat this k times

Transformers: 
 - to clean, reduce, expand, generate features
 - fit
 - transform
 - fit_transform

Pipeline:
 - to chain multiple transformers (last on has to be an estimator)
